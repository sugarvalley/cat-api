# THE CAT-API PROJECT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with usage of [The Dog Api](https://thedogapi.com/).

## Cat-api?

Yes. I went to the dark side and chose `dogs` instead.

## About

This project was created by sugar-valley for #CODE. It includes basics of HTML, CSS and React.

**Note: this is my very first project with React and my code looks like spaghetti. **

**Note 2: this project is: `IN PROGRESS` **
